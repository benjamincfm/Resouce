Good morning, TP, and good afternoon to my Chinese colleagues. My name is Fangming, and I work as a technician in the Product Optimization Department. Today, I will be talking about how we can improve the stability of our IHBsg product using the 6 Sigma method through the Green Belt Program.

Let's start by discussing the IHBsg product, which is a Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Test. Currently, we produce this product using a sheet-to-sheet process, which has its drawbacks. It has low production efficiency, high production costs, and limits the maximum production batch to 7000 sheets per batch. However, by introducing an automated process, we can overcome these issues and increase the maximum batch size to 12000 sheets.

One of the main areas where we can achieve cost savings is the NC (Nitrocellulose membrane) Spraying Process and the type of polyester used. Different solutions can lead to various cost savings, ranging from at least US

In 2020, we conducted a stability study on the product with the automated process, but the results were poor. The stability study chart from 2020 shows that after 24 days of accelerated stability testing, the sensitivity results of two different sample pads did not meet the criteria.

To understand the key stakeholders involved in this project, we have created a stakeholder map. It identifies the key parties as POD, R&D, Manufacture, E&A, and QA.

Now, let's take a look at the process map. The entire process consists of four steps, each producing a measurable standard called small y. We have identified some controllable and noise factors, referred to as "X," for each step. Ultimately, we output the big Y by going through all the steps. In this project, we have identified the NC Spraying Process and Polyester type as key factors. The two big Y outputs we are concerned with are the 2ng/ml cutoff sensitivity and Negative Specificity.

The IHBsg product works based on the principle of antigen-antibody reaction. The NC membrane plays a crucial role in adsorbing proteins and immobilizing the antibody or antigen on the membrane. Polyester, on the other hand, helps reconstitute and release conjugation quickly and uniformly, directly impacting the sensitivity of the product. Hence, these materials are vital for the IHBsg product and have been identified as key factors.

To give you a visual representation, here is a diagram of the product components, highlighting the locations of the key components, NC Membrane and Polyester. These components are assembled into cards and cut into strips with specified sizes. For the accelerated stability study, the product is placed in a 55°„C oven. At specific time points, the product is removed from the oven and evaluated for sensitivity and specificity.

Our sampling plan involves two factors: NC Spraying Process and Type of polyester. The first factor has two levels: Manual and Roll to Roll. The second factor has three levels: 210D, 113D, and 310D. Each variant will be evaluated for sensitivity and specificity, repeated four times.

The experiment results were visually read by operators using the Gold Color card, and the operators were evaluated according to the SOP.

We have conducted a Design of Experiments (DOE) in JMP, as shown in this screenshot. The factors are defined as categoricals, and the Power values are very close to 1, representing a high probability of detecting a significant effect.

Now, let's look at the table showing the results of the 2ng/ml cutoff sensitivity and Negative Specificity. The negative sample results show no difference, both being 1. However, there is a significant difference in the sensitivity results between the groups.

It's evident that regardless of how the factors change, the result of the negative sample (Specificity) remains the same and meets the criteria. We will now focus on analyzing the sensitivity.

This screenshot shows the Variability chart in JMP. According to the main effect and cross-effect results, polyester appears to be the most important factor. The sensitivity is higher with the 310D polyester type, and the difference between the three polyester types lies in the raw material, treated buffer, and treated process. On the other hand, the Spraying Process has a low impact on the result, accounting for only 1.2% of the effect. The effect within is acceptable.

Moving on to the Fit Model Analysis, the P-values for polyester are less than 0.05, indicating a significant impact on sensitivity.

Now, let's move on to the Process Prediction. The optimized conditions for sensitivity are "Roll to roll" Spraying Process and 310D polyester. These conditions have been fixed in the simulator, which predicts 2000 tests.

The Process Capability Analysis chart shows that the CPK and Cpl values are 1.356, indicating good and acceptable process capability (°›1.33). The LSL 4 is based on the 2ng/ml cutoff QC criteria (°›G4), and the USL 6 is based on the internal control POD criteria (°‹G6).

In the next part, we will discuss the Improvement Plan. The feasibility study will be completed by early January 2024, and the effective changes will be implemented by the end of July 2024.

Following the improvement plan, we will conduct data analysis to confirm the improvement. So far, we have managed to improve sensitivity by half a level. However, since the data is from the feasibility study, we are unable to obtain more data at the moment.

Once the effective product is applied in manufacturing in August 2024, we can expect to see potential cost savings. We will continue monitoring the sensitivity and specificity until the end of March 2026.

Through the IHBsg Product stability improvement project, we anticipate annual savings of approximately $12,884. I have learned how to apply JMP software and the problem-solving methods during this Green Belt project. I will use this knowledge to tackle issues in my future work. This project can also serve as a reference for improving the sensitivity of other infectious disease (ID) products.

Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to Jason for providing us with excellent training. I am thankful for the valuable suggestions I received during the learning process. I would also like to thank Joyce for giving me this opportunity to learn, make progress, and providing support for the project. Additionally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of my team member, Frances, for her contributions to this project.
